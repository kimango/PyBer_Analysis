## Summary: 3 business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
1. Pyber should provide more rides to the rural areas to increase the number of passangers and fares. 
2. Pyber should improve the number of rides to the suburban and rural areas to give equal amount of outcome to the different city types. 
3. Pyber should decrease the fare rate to the urban city riders to increase more people to ride to use their service.
